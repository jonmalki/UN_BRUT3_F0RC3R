# UN_BRUT3_F0RC3R
The script generates secure passwords using a combination of scrypt key derivation function and the Argon2 hashing algorithm, making them highly resistant to brute-force attacks. The process is made even more secure with the use of a random salt and multiple threads to generate and hash passwords
